### [3] Introduction
Fair Burger is a full stack mobile application made using React Native. It is cross-platform and runs seamlessly on iOS and Android phones. The backend for this project is built using Node. Fair burger is an app that helps street vendors to manage queues in their stalls. This app is made by keeping burger vendors in mind (street vendors), hence the name Fair Burger. With this app, vendors can add/delete items to menu. Then, they can add orders based on their menu. The orders will be added to queue screen.  Of course, they may delete orders too. At this point, I don't want to bore you with too much of text. You may see the live version (see point 1) or the screenshots of this app (see point 5) if you don't have access to your phone.

### [6] How to Run the Project Locally
If you want to just view the completed, hosted version of this app, refer point 1 above. Otherwise, keep reading. Fork this repository and clone it to your machine. Make sure you've got Node, MongoDB, and Expo CLI installed on your machine. You may Google how to do so as it's very simple and I don't want to pollute my README file and bore you with too much of instructions. In the backend folder, add a .env file and paste the following code:
    
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/temporaryDB
    JWT_SECRET_KEY=thisisafakejwtsecretkey
Then install all frontend and backend dependencies by typing ```npm i``` in terminal for frontend and backend folder individually. Then, run the backend server by typing ```nodemon index.js``` in the terminal under backend folder. Then, launch the app from the frontend folder in the terminal by typing ```npm start```. A website will be launched. Follow the instructions in that site to view the app on your mobile phone. If the instructions change in future, please paste this phrase to Google search engine and do a super quick research: "How to run an Expo app from my mobile phone".
